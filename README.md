# DynAtom

**DynAtom** is a lightweight Python application for visualizing **2D molecular dynamics in real time** and exploring how different parameters affect particle behavior. 

It displays:

- a simulation box containing atoms (via PyQtGraph ScatterPlot)
- their motions
- live-updated energy graphs

The interface is built using **PyQt5** and **PyQtGraph**.

*Physical behavior and visuals may include simplified approximations for clarity and performance.*
